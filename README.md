# Mod2AdvCSSPortfolio
# Rutgers Bootcamp Challenge 2 - Professional Portfolio using Advanced CSS

## Description
I created this website to showcase my web development skills to potential employers. 

User Story:
AS AN employer<br>
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples<br>
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position<br>

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work<br>
WHEN I load their portfolio<br>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them<br>
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section<br>
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications<br>
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application<br>
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others<br>
WHEN I click on the images of the applications<br>
THEN I am taken to that deployed application<br>
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices<br>
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport<br>

## Features

The main features in this project are:
1. My name, a recent photo and links to info about me, my work and how to contact me appear on this website
2. I created the website using Semantic, responsive HTML code and advanced CSS, including flexboxes
3. Project links open in a new window
4. Different color appears when hovering over a text link
5. Clicking on a link in the navigation takes you to that section on the website
6. The first application in the course shows as a larger box than the subsequent projects

## Tests

I used ChromeDevTools to help debug issues.  I tested all the links and features, ie. hover, opening the project links in a new window, and pointing to the correct images from the nav.
