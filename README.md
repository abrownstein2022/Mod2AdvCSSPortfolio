# Mod2AdvCSSPortfolio
# Rutgers Bootcamp Challenge 2 - Professional Portfolio using Advanced CSS

## Description

```md
I created this website to showcase my web development skills to potential employers. 

User Story:
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples< >
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the other
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

I used ChromeDevTools to help debug issues.  I tested all the links and features, ie. hover, opening the project links in a new window, and pointing to the correct images from the nav.
