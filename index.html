          <p>Welcome to my website so you can view my portfolio! I have been an IT professional for over 25 years, working as a Business 
             Analyst, Software & ETL Developer, Project Manager and more. I have worked for and with software companies, created
             many database systems on the web and on company servers that run businesses.  I write documentation and train
             users, as well as support users.  I enjoy working with individuals and businesses to deliver what they
             want and need to fulfill their goals.
             <br><br>
             I have recently also gotten back into web programming and have learned the latest technology, including
             git/GitHub, Agile project management, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs and more. 
             <br><br>
             I am a science fiction and sports enthusiast. I have loved Star Trek and loved sports since I was a child.  I was 
             swam competitively, played field hockey, softball and lacrosse.  As an adult, I love to spin and play pickleball.  I love watching
             tennis, volleyball and winter sports on televsion.  The winter and summer olypmics are my favorites because sports are on 
             multiple channels for a long time. 
             <br><br>
