     <h1>About Me</h1> 
     <p>Welcome to my website so you can view my portfolio! I have been an IT professional for over 25 years, working
      as a Business
      Analyst, Software & ETL Developer, Project Manager and more. I have worked for and with software companies,
      created
      many database systems on the web and on company servers that run businesses. I write documentation and train
      users, as well as support users. I enjoy working with individuals and businesses to deliver what they
      want and need to fulfill their goals.
      <br><br>
      I have recently also gotten back into web programming, learning the latest technology, including
      git/GitHub, Agile project management, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs and more.
      <br><br>
      I am a science fiction and sports enthusiast. I have loved Star Trek and sports since I was a child. I swam competitively, and played field hockey, softball and lacrosse. As an adult, I love to spin and play pickleball.
      I emjoy watching tennis, volleyball and winter sports on televsion. The winter and summer olypmics are my favorites because
      sports are on multiple channels for a long time.
      <br><br>
